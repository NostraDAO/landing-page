          <p>
            NostraCity is a competition of Defi families that fight each other
            by driving up sales of simple NFTs of their sponsored business in
            each season lasting 3 weeks. The family who drives up the highest
            amount of sales, wins a windfall of extra $BOSS tokens. Losing
            families win the same amount of tokens they invested. All families
            will be able to keep NFTs, and use the $BOSStoken to purchase their
            own DAAS nodes in the form of yield-bearing NFTs for further
            seasons.
